Four Little Warriors 2 (Multiplayer prototype)

This is an Unity Engine learning project with focus on local and remote multiplayer
infrastructure.
Both Splitscreen and Authoritative (with and without lag compensation) are supported.
The current version has the network basics working, but is unfinished otherwise!

As base for gameplay requirements "Four Little Warriors", an old project of mine, was taken.
